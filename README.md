# REU-VR-Application-for-attention-guidance

This code was created in order to test the application i created toguide the attention of Virtual Reality users. FOV Application involved a 
Robot search task where the user would be intructed to find a robot that would only appear when the application for guiding attention began.
The application is an eye shaped filter that moves into the users field of view toward the direction that is desired. If you want the 
user to turn left, then the application will enter on the right side and move towards the left. New study design was a second
form of testing the application where participants where asked to perform a stroop test in VR. after some time the filter enters and 
if the participants shifts their attention then they will find a special variation of the stroop test. The codes also write data to 
CSV files, the data is the Occulus head position data measuring how the participant moved in response to the application.
